There are two key parts to this question: the mobile client that must have an endpoint\n     to which it can send data and the receiver for a huge amount of data, as the question\n     indicates millions of users. Mobile SDK is a bit of a giveaway for the mobile component.\n     This also helpfully narrows the answer choices down to A and B. Of the two options,\n     Kinesis and EC2, only Kinesis is built to handle a massive data stream. While you could\n     theoretically scale up enough EC2 instances to serve an API for that volume of requests, it\n     really makes no sense. Kinesis is built for incoming data streams, so is the better option.","ans":["B"]},{"qnum":"49.","question":" Which of the following is required to set up a new AWS account for a company new to\n      AWS?","choices":["A.

Both the Administrators and the Power Users default policies provide read and\n     write access to most AWS services. Power Users limits access to IAM, but that would not\n     affect access to S3 or EC2.","ans":["A","D"]},{"qnum":"51.","question":" What does AWS call a document that defines a set of one or more permissions?","choices":["A.

You can avoid having to explicitly manage and provision servers."],"answer":" C, D. Containers allow you to reduce startup times, as they are launched into already-\n      running instances in most cases (C). This also touches on AWS’s facility to manage and\n      provision the instances on which the containers run (D), another advantage.

ECS, EMR, EC2","C.  Fargate, ECS, S3","D.  ECR, ECS, S3"],"answer":" A. The first thing here is to know these various acronyms. ECR is the Elastic Container\n      Registry, ECS is the Elastic Container Service, EC2 is Elastic Compute Cloud, EMR is\n      Elastic MapReduce, and of course S3 is Simple Storage Service. Given that, only A has all\n      the needed components: the registry (ECR), the management service (ECS), and instances\n      on which to run containers (EC2).

ECR is the Elastic Container Registry,\n      ECS is the Elastic Container Service, EMR is Elastic MapReduce, and S3 is Simple Storage\n      Service. ECC isn’t an AWS acronym, so it is immediately out.

You have limited resources for managing your existing EC2 instances.","D.  You need to scale up and down your applications."],"answer":" B, C. Containers allow you to co-locate applications on instances and more effectively\n      use your available instances without a lot of overhead, so B is true. C is in a similar vein:\n      Containers reduce the management overhead of instances. A is not true, as containers\n      don’t significantly change your cost structure, and D is false, as containers and instances\n      can both scale up and down to meet demand.","ans":["B","C"]},{"qnum":"57.","question":" Which of the following are differences between container-based applications and\n     Lambda-based ones?

Containers are not as highly scalable as Lambda.","D.  Containers can run entire application stacks; Lambda can only run isolated chunks ofcode.By Brett McLaughlinions Architect Practice Tests: Associate SAA-C01 ExamChapter       Practice Test6"],"answer":" A, D. Containers are applications (D) that scale based on application load (A). Lambda,\n      in contrast, runs isolated pieces of code and not entire application tiers. Additionally,\n      Lambda launches based on events rather than load. (Note that you could actually set up\n      load monitors in CloudWatch and trigger Lambda based on load, although that is not\n      automatic as it is in containers.)","ans":["A","D"]}]
