For all new AWS accounts, 20 instances are allowed per region. However, you can\n      increase this limit by requesting it via AWS support.","ans":["C"]},{"qnum":"313.","question":" You are using a NAT instance inside of a VPC to support routing out to the public Inter-\n      net from private instances within that VPC. As traffic has increased, the performance of\n      any operations involving the outbound Internet traffic has degraded to unacceptable lev-\n      els. How would you mitigate this problem?","choices":["A. Add an additional internet gateway so the NAT instance can split outbound trafficover two gateways.","B.  Add an additional elastic IP to the NAT instance to increase throughput.","C.  Increase the instance size of the NAT instance by one or more instance size classes.","D.  All of these are valid solutions."],"answer":" C. The only one of these that makes sense is C, increasing the size of the NAT instance. It\n      is impossible to add an additional internet gateway to a VPC that already has one (A), and\n      adding an additional elastic IP requires using a newer EC2 instance, and it will not affect\n      performance in this case (B).","ans":["C"]},{"qnum":"314.","question":" What is the simplest way to reduce frequent scaling in an application? For example, if an\n      application is showing that it’s scaling up and down multiple times in an hour, how would\n      you reduce the number of “ups and downs” you are seeing?","choices":["A.  Set up scheduled times with proactive cycling for the scaling so that it is not occur-ring all the time.","B.  Increase the cooldown timers so that scaling down requires greater thresholds ofchange in your triggers.","C.  Update CloudWatch to use a FIFO termination policy, only terminating the oldestinstances in a scaledown.","D.  None of these will improve the issue."],"answer":" B. If instances are scaling up and down quickly, this means that the thresholds for\n      adding and removing instances are being met frequently. Since you don’t want to reduce\n      the scaling up to meet demand, you should increase what it takes for the system to scale\n      down; that’s what B suggests. Proactive cycling (A) won’t help the situation and C is\n      completely made up.","ans":["B"]},{"qnum":"315.","question":" Which of these steps are required to get a NAT instance working? (Choose two.)","choices":["A. Update the routing table for EC2 instances accessing the public Internet to gothrough the NAT instance.","B.  Locate the NAT instance within the private subnet that it will be serving.","C.  Disable source/destination checks on your instance.","D.  Set the NAT instance to allow port forwarding from the private subnet."],"answer":" A, C. Routing is one of the most important steps (A); you must set the route to the public\n      Internet to go to the NAT instance. Additionally, you need to disable source/destination\n      checks, a commonly forgotten step (C). The NAT instance cannot be in a private subnet\n      (B), and D doesn’t make sense in this context.","ans":["A","C"]},{"qnum":"316.","question":" Which of these is not a default CloudWatch metric?","choices":["A.  Disk read operations","B.  Memory usage","C.  CPU usage","D.  Inbound network traffic"],"answer":" B. This is a tough one because it must simply be memorized. CloudWatch provides disk\n      read operations, CPU usage, and inbound network traffic but does not provide memory\n      usage by default.","ans":["B"]},{"qnum":"317.","question":" You have an existing fleet of EC2 instances in a public subnet of your VPC. You launch\n      an additional instance from the same AMI as the existing instances, into the same public\n      subnet. What steps might you need to take to ensure that this instance can reach the pub-\n      lic Internet? (Choose two.)","choices":["A. Assign an elastic IP address to the instance.","B.  Add the instance to the ELB serving the existing instances.","C.  Add the instance into a private subnet.","D.  Ensure that the instance has a route out to the Internet."],"answer":" A, B. The instance will need an elastic IP for public communication (A) and should be\n      behind the same ELB as the other instances (B). Adding it into a private subnet (C) will\n      remove its ability to communicate with the public Internet. D looks good, but if the\n      instance is in the same subnet as the other instances, it automatically gets their routes;\n      routing tables apply to the subnet, not a specific instance.","ans":["A","B"]},{"qnum":"318.","question":" Which of the following is the destination address for the public Internet?","choices":["A. 192.168.1.255/0","B.  0.0.0.0/16","C.  169.254.169.254/0","D.  0.0.0.0/0"],"answer":" D.
