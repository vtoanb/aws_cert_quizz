A bastion host is a publicly accessible host that allows traffic to connect to it. Then,\n      an additional connection is made from the bastion host into a private subnet and the\n      hosts within that subnet. Because the bastion must be accessed by public clients, it must\n      be exposed to the Internet (A). If it is within a private subnet (B), it will not be accessible,\n      making that answer incorrect. There also must be an explicit route from the bastion host\n      into the private subnet (C); this is usually within a NACL. Finally, the security of the\n      bastion must be different from the hosts in the private subnet. The bastion host should be\n      hardened significantly as it is public, but also accessible; this is in many ways the opposite\n      of the security requirements of hosts within a private subnet.","ans":["A","C"]},{"qnum":"4.","question":" Which of the following are invalid IAM actions?

There are two pairs of answers here, and you need to choose the correct pair in\n      each case. For private subnet instances, you need a route out to a NAT gateway, and that\n      NAT gateway must be in a public subnet—otherwise, it would not itself be able to provide\n      outbound traffic access to the Internet.

It is your responsibility to patch a NAT instance and AWS’s responsibility to patch aNAT gateway.","D.  You assign a security group to a NAT instance but not to a NAT gateway."],"answer":" A, B. The easiest way to handle this question is by thinking of a NAT gateway as\n      essentially a managed service and a NAT instance as an instance (which you manage) for\n      networking. That helps identify B as false (you never choose instance types and sizes for\n      managed services) and C as true (AWS patches managed services).

Bastion host","B.  VPC endpoint","C.  Internet gateway","D.  NAT instance"],"answer":" A. Of these options, only bastion hosts and NAT instances are unmanaged services,\n      making them the only two possible answers. A bastion host typically has SSH routing and\n      permissions to private instances, making it the most important to properly secure.

It is the first account created.","B.  It is ideal for everyday tasks.","C.  It is intended primarily for creating other users and groups.","D.  It has access keys that are important to keep."],"answer":" A, C. The root account is the first account in every account (A), but it should only be used\n      for creating other users and groups (C). It is not intended for everyday tasks (B), and once\n      account setup is complete, you are encouraged by AWS to delete any access keys (D).","ans":["A","C"]},{"qnum":"223.","question":" Which of the following are appropriate password policy requirements?

Users with console access should be required to use MFA.","D.  None. These users should be treated the same as other users."],"answer":" C. Users with console access are more privileged users and should be required to use MFA\n      (C). Password policies apply to all users, so A is incorrect. Further, passwords are the\n      mechanism for logging into the console, so B is wrong in that access keys are not used for\n      console login.","ans":["C"]},{"qnum":"225.","question":" Which of the following provide a means of federating users from an existing organiza-\n      tion?

An SCP in AWS Organizations is a service control policy and can be applied to an\n      organizational unit (OU) to affect all users within that OU.

A service control policy","B.  An organizational unit","C.  An LDAP user store","D.  IAM roles"],"answer":" A. Service control policies (SCPs) provide for working across AWS accounts (A).\n      Organizational units (OUs) are groupings of accounts, and IAM roles are applied to users\n      and groups, not cross-account structures.","ans":["A"]},{"qnum":"231.","question":" What AWS service would you use for managing and enforcing policies for multiple AWS\n      accounts?","choices":["A.

Which S3 encryption solution should you use?","choices":["A. SSE-C","B.  SSE-S3","C.  SSE-KMS","D.  Amazon S3 Encryption Client"],"answer":" B. SSE-S3 offers encryption at rest while deferring key management to AWS. SSE-KMS\n      does the same but has a higher cost and is more suitable for stringent auditing.

Create a new IAM user for each developer and assign the required permissions toeach user.","C.   Create a new IAM user for each developer, create a single group with the requiredpermissions, and assign each user to that group.","D.   Create a new SCP and assign the SCP to an OU with each user’s credentials withinthat OU."],"answer":" C. New users should be given a new IAM user, and when permissions are the same across\n      users, a group should be used instead of individually assigning permissions.","ans":["C"]},{"qnum":"236.","question":" Your application requires a highly available storage solution.

Infrastructure services","B.  Managed services","C.  Containers services","D.  Abstracted services"],"answer":" B. This is pretty tough unless you’ve read the AWS shared responsibility white papers and\n      FAQs.

IAM role","B.  IAM policy","C.  IAM user","D.  AWS organizational unit"],"answer":" A. An IAM role is assumed by an EC2 instance when it needs to access other AWS\n      services, and that role has permissions associated with it.

The task does not have access to an S3 VPC endpoint.","D.  There is no policy defined to allow ECS tasks to access S3."],"answer":" A, D. Just as is the case with a compute instance (EC2), a task in a container needs an\n      IAM role with permissions to access S3 (A), which in turn requires a policy specifying a\n      permission that lets ECS tasks access S3 (D).
